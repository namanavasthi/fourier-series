# Fourier Series

A Fourier Series is a periodic function composed of harmonically related sinusoids, combined by a weighted summation.

# Definition

A Fourier series is a representation of a periodic function as a sum of orthogonal sinusoids, each with an integer number of cycles in the period of the function. In general, the series has an infinite number of such harmonics. We begin with a simple example and then generalize it.

# About Code

This code is intended to use P5 and visualize a nth harmonic fourier series.

Fourier coefficients used : 4 sin(n * theta) / n*PI
where n is odd
